# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (the Foundry 11 principles). A
plan MUST be able to answer each gate; mark N/A with a one-line reason where a
principle does not apply to this feature.

- [ ] **I. Evidence Over Assertion** — any "real"/"done"/"fixed" claim the plan
      makes is backed by a checkable, mechanically verifiable signal, not model
      confidence.
- [ ] **II. Surface Only What Survives** — only outputs that passed a gate are
      shown to a human; everything else stays internal.
- [ ] **III. Liveness By Heartbeat** — long-running work judges health by
      heartbeat/progress, never by wall-clock alone.
- [ ] **IV. Claims Are Atomic And Mortal** — shared work units are claimed
      atomically and released automatically if the holder dies.
- [ ] **V. The Provider Is The Rate Arbiter** — no internal pre-throttle below a
      provider's real limit; adapt to its backpressure.
- [ ] **VI. Coverage Before Yield** — no "done"/auto-stop before the stated
      goals were credibly attempted.
- [ ] **VII. Exploited Means Demonstrated** — any "exploited"/proven claim comes
      from an independent reproduction, never inference.
- [ ] **VIII. Fingerprints Are Stable Under Edit** — identity is structural
      (path + symbol + class), excludes line numbers/snippets.
- [ ] **IX. Sandbox By Infrastructure** — egress/write boundaries are enforced by
      the runtime, not by prompt.
- [ ] **X. The Operator Outranks Every Agent** — operator input is authoritative;
      no silent changes; automated decisions are overridable and recorded.
- [ ] **XI. Persist Atomically** — shared artifacts are written-then-swapped;
      no delete-then-write.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
